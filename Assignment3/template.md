# Intent of the application

The purpose of this application is to explore clustering techniques, as well as a dimensionality reduction technique (Principal Component Analysis) and compare the results in a dataframe where the reduction technique was applied and a dataframe where it was not applied. 

# Dataset to be used, including source

The dataset to be used is the Iris dataset, for which more information can be found here: https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-iris-dataset/

# Use case

This application can be used to demonstrate the usefulness of both clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction technique with a well known dataset, which would allow for easy reproduction. 

# Variables

Sepal.Length: The length of the sepal, which is the outer part of the flower that encloses a developing bud. 
Sepal.Width: The width of the sepal.
Petal.Length: The length of the petal of the flower, which are leaves that surround the reproductive parts of a flower. 
Petal.Width: The width of the petal of the flower. 

# Labels

Species: Describes the species of the flower associated to the previous measurements. 

# Data import

In this application, there is no input needed from the user.

# Libraries

Sklearn: Used to import the Iris dataset. 
Numpy: Used to obtain the norm of a vector, and the distance between two vectors
Pandas: Used to manage the vectors in the Iris dataset, as well as to perform the dot product between two vectors.

# Proposed solution

# Application outputs

The expected outputs for this application are: 

The results of applying clustering techniques to a dataframe of the original dataset, and to the same dataframe after applying a dimensionality reduction technique (Principal Component Analysis).
