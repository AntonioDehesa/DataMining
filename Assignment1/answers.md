# Vectors

Quantities that cannot be represented with just a number, but require a magnitude and a direction. 
But in CS, the term more commonly refers to a one-dimension array. 

# Matrix

In math, it is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols or expressions, ordered in rows and columns. 
But in CS, it can have more dimensions. 
They are regularly used in CS to represent observations, in which the first row represents the names of the columns, and the rest of the rows
represent a different observation. However, their uses are varied. 

# Linear equations

Linear equations are those that can be represented simply by a variable or set of variables, multiplied by coefficients.
An example of this would be: a1x1 + a2b2 + a5b5 = y.
These coefficients can usually be considered parameters of the function.
